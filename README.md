Mathematics for Computer Science and Mathematics for Machine Learning


This repository contains the lecture notes pdf version of mathamatics for computer science and Mathematics for Machine learning lecture slides delivered by Marc Deisenroth (current Professor at UCL) department of computing ICL. It covers part on Linear Algebra will
cover linear equation systems (and their solution), linear mappings and their matrix representations, vector spaces, eigenvalues, affine mappings, and applications, e.g., projections and rotations.
There are many courses in the department that require an understanding of mathematical
concepts. These courses range from optimization, operations research and
complexity to machine learning, robotics, graphics and computer vision.
