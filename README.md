This repository contains the lecture notes pdf version of mathamatics for computer science delivered by ICL department of computing. The part on Linear Algebra will
cover linear equation systems (and their solution), linear mappings and their matrix representations, vector spaces, eigenvalues, affine mappings, and applications, e.g., projections and rotations.
There are many courses in the department that require an understanding of mathematical
concepts. These courses range from optimization, operations research and
complexity to machine learning, robotics, graphics and computer vision.
